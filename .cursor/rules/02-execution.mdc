# 🖥️ COMMAND EXECUTION: Advise, Don't Run

## Rule: User runs commands, agent advises

For benchmarks, servers, training, or any long-running commands:

✗ WRONG: Agent runs the command directly
✓ RIGHT: Agent says "Please run this command:" and provides it

## Example

Instead of running:
```bash
./benchmark.sh --config test
```

Say:
> Please run this command:
> ```
> ./benchmark.sh --config test 2>&1 | tee benchmark.log
> ```
> Let me know when it completes and I'll analyze the results.

## Why?
- User sees full output in real-time
- User maintains control
- Agent can analyze log file after completion
