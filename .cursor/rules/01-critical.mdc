# 🚫 CRITICAL: FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

These actions are NEVER allowed without explicit user permission:

1. **Running benchmarks/servers/training** — Tell user the command, don't run it yourself
2. **git add -A** or **git add .** — Always use `git add <specific-files>`
3. **Committing gpucore/core dump files** — Check `git status` first
4. **pip install without checking** — Run `pip show <pkg>` first
5. **Reinstalling editable packages** — They persist, ask before reinstalling
6. **Pushing to upstream** — Only push to YOUR fork
7. **Retrying failed approaches** — Check [TRIED] comments, try DIFFERENT approach
8. **Giving up silently** — Always offer alternatives before abandoning
