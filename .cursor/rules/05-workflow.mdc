# 📋 WORKFLOW RULES

## Attempt Tracking
After a failed approach, add inline comment:
```
# [TRIED] approach-name - reason it failed
```
This prevents retrying the same failed approaches.

## Goal Stability
- Marking tasks complete: OK without asking
- Removing/changing tasks: REQUIRES user permission
- Format: "I'd like to change X to Y because Z. Approve?"

## When Stuck
✗ NEVER say "this is too complex" and give up
✓ ALWAYS offer alternatives:
  "I've tried A, B, C. Options: 1) Try D, 2) Clarify X, 3) Abandon (OK?)"

## Package Installation
Before `pip install`:
1. Run `pip show <package>` to check if installed
2. Editable installs persist — don't reinstall
3. ImportError? Check venv activation first
4. If unsure: ASK before reinstalling
